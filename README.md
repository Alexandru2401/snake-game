# Snake-game
This is a simple version of one of the most popular games ever: the snake game. The game is very simple: you start with a snake, and you must eat food (the red part that appears on the screen). Once the snake eats the food, its size grows by one, the score increases by 10, and another piece of food will be displayed on the screen. If you hit the wall, the game is over. Also, if the head of the snake hits one of its parts, the game is over.

To start the game, you must click on the "start" button, and the game will begin. After the game is over, you can start another game by clicking on the "restart" button.

Let's see the highest score that you can get!
Good luck and have fun!
